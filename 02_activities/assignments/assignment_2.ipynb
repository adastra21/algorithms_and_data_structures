Question 2 seemed like a relatively easy binary tree problem but the solution took longer than I had expected. I also missed Part 2 because it was hidden locally by VCS for some reason! (I recently commited Part 2 â€“ hopefully it made it in time for my partner's assignment).\n",

I assumed that there would be no way to improve it, but by working through the time and space complexity for each step respectively, I realized that it was also possible to improve such an elegant use of set operations. My main takeway is that thinking deeply about time and space complexity is a great way to review code and find ways to improve it.\n",

It's also a free dopamine hit!"
